Abstraction refers to the process of hiding the internal implementation details of a class while providing a simplified interface for the user. Encapsulation, on the other hand, involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class, and controlling access to that unit through access specifiers.


In this example:

Abstraction: The user interacts with the BankAccount class through a simplified interface of functions (deposit, withdraw, displayBalance). The internal details of how the balance is managed and account operations are implemented are hidden from the user.

Encapsulation: The BankAccount class encapsulates the data (account number and balance) and methods (deposit, withdraw, displayBalance) into a single unit. The data members (accountNumber and balance) are private, meaning they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Access to these members is controlled through public member functions.
Together, abstraction and encapsulation provide a way to manage complexity, improve code readability, and enhance code maintainability in object-oriented programming.
